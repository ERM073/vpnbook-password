# vpnbook-password
Real-time VPNBook password.

## â€»This repository's technology relies on OCR, making it unstable.

No license, but please press star on the repository to motivate my development!

I update the password on my home server, so it may be unstable.

## Passwords are updated once every 12 hours. (Updated twice a day)

To spread out the load due to the occasional sudden password updates by VPNBook and by overloading the VPNVook with passwords.

## Don't worry if vpn_password.txt was last updated days or even months ago.
This is because the GitHub API does not update the file date if the file content (password) is the same.

## If you have a problem, please report it via ISSUES.
