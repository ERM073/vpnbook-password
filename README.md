# vpnbook-password
Real-time VPNBook password retrieved **directly from Facebook (no longer OCR-based)**.

## ✅ Now more accurate: We've switched from OCR to direct Facebook scraping!

The system was improved by scraping directly from the official VPNBook SNS rather than using OCR technology, which is prone to false positives.

No license is applied, but your star encourages me to continue maintaining this service.

The password is retrieved from Facebook using a private home server.  
Due to Facebook UI changes or restrictions, occasional errors might still occur.

## 🔁 Passwords are checked and updated every 12 hours.

VPNBook sometimes changes passwords without notice.  
This project checks and updates twice a day to reduce the risk of outdated info.

## 🕒 Don't worry if `vpn_password.txt` hasn't been updated for days.

If the password hasn’t changed, the GitHub API does not update the file timestamp—this is expected behavior.
